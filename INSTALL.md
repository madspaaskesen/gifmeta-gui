## 🧭 Installation Instructions

### 🪟 Windows

> ✅ Simply **double-click** the `gifmeta-gui.exe` file
> No installation needed. If SmartScreen warns you, click "More info" → "Run anyway".

---

### 🍏 macOS

**Note for macOS users**:
If you see a warning that the app is from an “unidentified developer,” open:
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow Anyway**, then relaunch it.

This is normal for indie tools and does not indicate anything harmful. ✨

---

### 🐧 Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-like)

1. **Download** the `gifmeta-gui` binary
2. Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x gifmeta-gui
```

3. Run it:

```bash
./gifmeta-gui
```

If you get a "quarantine" or missing library error, install these dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.1-dev
```
